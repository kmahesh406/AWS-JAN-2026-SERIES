# AWS Identity and Access Management – IAM Policy Limitations (Complete Guide)

---

## 1. What Are IAM Policy Limitations?

IAM policy limitations define **how many policies you can create, attach, and how large they can be**, along with **structural and functional boundaries** of IAM.

These limits exist to:

* Maintain performance
* Prevent overly complex permission evaluation
* Encourage clean and scalable IAM design

Understanding these limits is **mandatory** for real-world AWS usage.

---

## 2. Policy Size Limits

### Maximum Policy Document Size

* **Customer Managed Policy**: **6,144 characters**
* **Inline Policy**: **2,048 characters**

If the policy exceeds this size:

* AWS will reject the policy
* You must split it into multiple policies

### Practical Impact

* Large wildcard policies fit easily
* Fine-grained policies with many ARNs may hit limits
* Over-engineering policies can cause failures

---

## 3. Policy Version Limits

### Versions per Customer Managed Policy

* Maximum **5 versions**
* Only **1 version can be active**

If you create a 6th version:

* You must delete an older version first

### Why This Matters

* Policy history is limited
* Poor version management can block updates
* Best practice: clean unused versions regularly

---

## 4. Policy Attachment Limits (Very Important)

### Policies Attached to a Principal (User / Group / Role)

* Maximum **10 managed policies** can be attached to:

  * One IAM user
  * One IAM group
  * One IAM role

This includes:

* AWS Managed Policies
* Customer Managed Policies

### Inline Policies

* **Unlimited inline policies** (not recommended)

> Even though inline policies have no numeric limit, they increase complexity and are harder to audit.

---

## 5. IAM Entity Policy Limits

### IAM User

* Max **10 managed policies**
* Unlimited inline policies

### IAM Group

* Max **10 managed policies**
* Unlimited inline policies

### IAM Role

* Max **10 managed policies**
* Unlimited inline policies

---

## 6. IAM Policy Content Limitations

### No Conditional Logic Like Programming

IAM policies:

* Do NOT support loops
* Do NOT support if-else logic
* Do NOT support variables (except policy variables)

Policies are **declarative**, not procedural.

---

## 7. Explicit Deny Behavior (Functional Limitation)

* **Explicit Deny always overrides Allow**
* You cannot override a Deny using another Allow

Example:

* Policy A → Allow EC2
* Policy B → Deny EC2
  ➡ Access is denied

This is by design and cannot be bypassed.

---

## 8. IAM Policies Do NOT Control Everything

IAM policies **cannot**:

* Stop AWS services automatically
* Enforce cost limits
* Block billing
* Replace AWS Budgets
* Replace Service Control Policies (SCPs)

IAM controls **permissions**, not **behavior**.

---

## 9. Resource-Level Limitation

Not all AWS services support **resource-level permissions**.

### Examples

* S3 → Supports bucket/object level
* EC2 → Many actions require `*`
* IAM → Mostly `*`
* CloudWatch → Partial support

This means:

* You may be forced to allow access to all resources for certain actions

---

## 10. Region Restriction Limitations

IAM policies:

* Are **global**
* Do not belong to a specific region

Region restriction is possible only via:

* Conditions (`aws:RequestedRegion`)
* SCPs (recommended for org-level control)

---

## 11. Policy Evaluation Complexity Limit

AWS limits the **total policy evaluation size** per request.

Includes:

* Identity policies
* Resource policies
* Permission boundaries
* SCPs
* Session policies

If the combined policy size is too large:

* Request may fail
* Permissions may not evaluate as expected

---

## 12. Permissions Boundary Limitations

* Permissions boundaries **do not grant access**
* They only **restrict maximum permissions**
* Must be used with identity policies

Common misunderstanding:

> “Boundary gives permission” ❌
> “Boundary limits permission” ✅

---

## 13. Inline Policy Limitations (Design Issue)

Although inline policies are allowed:

* They are tightly coupled to one identity
* Hard to reuse
* Hard to audit
* Easy to forget

AWS best practice:

* Prefer **Customer Managed Policies**
* Avoid inline policies in production

---

## 14. IAM Policy Does Not Guarantee Access

Even if IAM policy allows an action, access can still fail due to:

* SCP deny
* Resource-based policy deny
* Missing trust relationship (roles)
* VPC endpoint policy
* Organization restrictions

IAM is **one layer**, not the only layer.

---

## 15. Summary Table – Key IAM Policy Limits

| Item                          | Limit                |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Customer Managed Policy Size  | 6,144 characters     |
| Inline Policy Size            | 2,048 characters     |
| Policy Versions               | 5                    |
| Managed Policies per Identity | 10                   |
| Inline Policies               | Unlimited            |
| Explicit Deny                 | Cannot be overridden |
| Region Scope                  | Global               |
| Programming Logic             | Not supported        |

---

## 16. Real-World Design Best Practices

* Split large permissions into multiple policies
* Use groups and roles instead of users
* Avoid inline policies
* Track policy versions
* Use IAM Policy Simulator
* Combine IAM with SCPs and Budgets
* Always design for **least privilege**

---

## Final Note

IAM policies are powerful but **not unlimited**.

Strong AWS engineers know:

* What IAM **can** do
* What IAM **cannot** do
* When to use **SCP**, **Budgets**, **Organizations**, and **Resource Policies**
