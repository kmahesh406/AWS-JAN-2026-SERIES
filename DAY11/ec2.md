# Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Intro + Launching Windows & Linux Instances (Complete Notes)

This document explains **EC2 basics + the full logic behind launching a Windows server and a Linux server** in AWS, using a **production-style mindset** (tags, security, networking, access, and lifecycle).
It’s written so you can directly use it as GitHub documentation.

---

## 1) EC2 Instance = Virtual Server + Core Building Blocks

When you launch an EC2 instance, you’re essentially choosing a bundle of infrastructure components:

### OS Layer

* OS is provided using an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
* AMI is a **ready-made OS template** (Windows/Linux) that AWS can boot quickly (you don’t install OS manually). ([AWS Documentation][1])

### Compute Layer

* CPU + RAM come together as an **Instance Type**
* Example: `t3.micro`, `m5.large`, `c6i.xlarge`
* Instance type decides compute power, memory, and some networking capability. ([AWS Documentation][1])

### Storage Layer

* Primary disk for most instances is Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)
* Root volume contains the OS disk. (You can add extra EBS volumes later.)

### Network Layer

* Instance gets a virtual network card called Elastic Network Interface (ENI)
* ENI gives Private IP, optional Public IP, and connects instance to your VPC/subnet.

### Firewall Layer

* Firewall in AWS is mainly controlled using a **Security Group**
* Typical inbound ports:

  * Windows: RDP 3389
  * Linux: SSH 22

## 2) Step 1 — Add Tags (Mandatory in Real Projects)

Tags are key-value labels used to identify and manage resources. They help with:

* Searching/filtering
* Cost tracking
* Ownership mapping
* Environment separation (Dev/Test/Prod)
* Automation (scripts can act based on tags)

### Recommended tags for a training + project demo

* `Name` = `My-Windows-demo`
* `Project` = `B2B-BSS`
* `Client` = `jio`
* `Platform` = `Windows`


### Why Tag Editor matters

Tag Editor allows you to filter resources quickly by tags and find “who created what” without confusion.

**Trainer note:** Make it a rule: *No resource without tags.*

---

## 3) Step 2 — Choose an AMI (Choose OS)

### What AMI really means

An AMI is a **pre-built OS image** maintained by AWS or vendors:

* Windows Server AMIs (with Microsoft licensing)
* Linux AMIs (Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, RHEL, etc.)

AWS boots your selected AMI on the instance type you choose. ([AWS Documentation][1])

### What to teach here

* Windows AMI → RDP access, password decryption flow (key pair is used to decrypt Admin password)
* Linux AMI → SSH access using private key directly

---

## 4) Step 3 — Choose Instance Type (CPU + RAM Bundle)

Instance types are grouped into families based on workload needs. AWS documents these families and how they are categorized. ([AWS Documentation][1])

### A) General Purpose (balanced)

Use for:

* Web apps
* Small/medium services
* Dev/Test
* General workloads

Common families:

* `t` (burstable) — training & low-cost labs
* `m` (balanced) — stable production web/app

Examples:

* `t3.micro` (cheap labs)
* `m5.large` (balanced workloads)

### B) Compute Optimized (CPU heavy)

Use for:

* HPC
* batch processing
* CPU-intensive microservices
* build servers

Common families:

* `c` (example: `c5`, `c6`)

Example:

* `c6i.xlarge`

### C) Memory Optimized (RAM heavy)

Use for:

* in-memory caching
* memory-heavy DB engines
* analytics that needs high RAM

Common families:

* `r` (example: `r5`, `r6)
* `x` (specialized high memory)

### D) Storage Optimized (high IOPS / storage performance)

Use for:

* heavy disk workloads
* log processing
* distributed databases / graph workloads

Common families:

* `i`, `d` (varies by generation)

### E) GPU / Accelerated Computing

Use for:

* ML training/inference
* graphics rendering
* gaming/streaming

Common families:

* `g`, `p`, `f`

**Trainer best practice:**
Teach selection logic as: **Workload → CPU/RAM/IOPS/GPU need → family → size**

---

## 5) Step 4 — Choose Key Pair (Secure Authentication)

A key pair is a set of credentials made of:

* **Public key** (stored by AWS / placed on the instance)
* **Private key** (downloaded and stored by you)

AWS confirms:

* Public key is stored in EC2
* You keep the private key safely
* Linux uses private key for SSH
* Windows uses private key to decrypt the Administrator password ([AWS Documentation][2])

### Key pair rules to teach

* If private key is lost, you generally **cannot** SSH/RDP the same way again (recovery requires alternate methods)
* Never upload private key to GitHub
* Store `.pem` securely

---

## 6) Step 5 — Network Settings (VPC + Subnet + Security Group)

### A) Ports to open (based on OS)

* **Windows (RDP)**: TCP `3389`
* **Linux (SSH)**: TCP `22`

### B) Source rule best practice

Do **not** open to the world unless it’s a lab and you understand the risk.

Recommended:

* `My IP` (safest for training)
* or `Custom` with your office public IP `/32`

Only use `Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)` for temporary demos and remove it after testing.

### C) Public access requirements

To connect from your laptop:

* Instance must be in a public subnet (or have proper routing)
* Security group must allow inbound RDP/SSH
* Instance must have a reachable public endpoint (public IP or via a bastion/VPN/SSM)

---

## 7) Step 6 — Storage (Root Volume + Optional Disks)

### Root Volume

* The root volume is the disk that contains OS (Windows/Linux).
* Default is fine for initial demos.

### Important lifecycle concept (Data safety)

When an instance is terminated:

* Instance is permanently removed
* EBS volumes may be deleted or preserved depending on **DeleteOnTermination** setting ([AWS Documentation][3])

**Trainer line:**
“Stopping keeps instance disk; terminating may delete disk depending on settings.”

---

## 8) Connecting to a Windows EC2 Instance (RDP)

AWS standard method:

* Connect via **Remote Desktop** to Windows instances. ([AWS Documentation][4])

### What you need

* Public IP / public DNS of instance
* RDP allowed in security group (3389)
* Administrator password (decrypted using key pair)

### Windows laptop (RDP built-in)

* Open **Run**
* Type `mstsc`
* Enter Public IP / DNS of the instance
* Use `Administrator` + decrypted password

### macOS

* Install Microsoft Remote Desktop / Windows App (client)
* Connect using public IP/DNS + credentials

---

## 9) Connecting to a Linux EC2 Instance (SSH)

### What you need

* `.pem` private key
* SSH allowed in security group (22)
* Public IP / public DNS
* Correct username (depends on AMI)

Common usernames:

* Amazon Linux: `ec2-user`
* Ubuntu: `ubuntu`

### Example SSH command

```bash
chmod 400 mykey.pem
ssh -i mykey.pem ec2-user@<PUBLIC_IP>
```

---

## 10) Public IP vs Private IP (Must-Explain Concept)

### Public IP

* Globally routable on the internet
* Used when connecting from your laptop directly
* Can change when instance is stopped/started (unless you use a static IP solution)

### Private IP

* Works only inside the VPC network
* Used for internal communication:

  * app → db
  * microservices → microservices
* Not reachable directly from the internet

**Trainer example:**
“DB should be private IP only; application talks to DB privately.”

---

## 11) Stop vs Terminate (Real Project Behavior)

### Stop

* Instance shuts down
* You can start it again
* OS disk (EBS) generally remains, so data stays
* Compute charges stop; storage charges continue (EBS) ([AWS Documentation][5])

### Terminate

* Permanent delete of instance
* Cannot recover the instance
* Root volume may be deleted (default often deletes root volume) unless configured otherwise ([AWS Documentation][3])

**Trainer rule for students:**

* Stop = “pause”
* Terminate = “delete completely”

---

## 12) Best Practices to Add (Make Your Notes Stronger)

### Security

* Use `My IP` for SSH/RDP, not `Anywhere`
* Use separate security groups for Windows and Linux
* Don’t use root user for EC2 operations

### Cost

* Stop instances after demo
* Delete unused EBS volumes and snapshots
* Use tagging for cost tracking

### Operations

* Keep Windows password retrieval steps documented
* Use naming standards (`Name`, `Project`, `Env`, `Owner`, `CostCenter`)

---

## 13) Quick  Flow 

1. EC2 building blocks (AMI, instance type, EBS, ENI, SG)
2. Tags (why mandatory)
3. Windows launch (RDP path)
4. Linux launch (SSH path)
5. Public vs private IP
6. Stop vs terminate + data impact
